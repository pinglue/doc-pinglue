Pinglue at its core is a bootstrapper tool which combine individual packages into a single and functioning apps.

These packages should follow a set of protocols and rules in order to be bootstrapped by Pinglue along with other packages. So working with Pinglue also requires knowing these rules and protocols to some degree. And if you want to develop Pinglue packages then a more detailed knowledge will be needed. 

The point is, Pinglue is not just a tool that you npm-install it, but also an architecture and protocol which allow different software engineers to combine their works (=packages) into single apps. So every need sto be aware of them to some degree and follow them so that the system can work.

However, since the goal of Pinglue is simplicity and practicality, these rules and protocol are kept at the bare minimum level which is necessary to run a communicative system. Pinglue tries to avoid complications, multi-option tradeoffs and vague ways to do things.

The best place to start learning about Pinglue is the [Hello world tutorial](:hello-world-tl), which walks you through the fundamental concepts in a simplified way (and may be a bit over-simplified). After that you may start other more realistic tutorials.
