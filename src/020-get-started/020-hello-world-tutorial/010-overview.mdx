title: Overview

This tutorial is the best place to start to learn a rough idea of Pinglue in a hands-on way. Each section in this tutorial introduces a fundamental concept of Pinglue in a simple and practical language.

The operations used in this tutorial are *over-simplified* and they go as much as printing a *hello world* console log. This may hide some practical and real-world application of the features offered by Pinglue, and in some cases it may not make much sense. But it is needed to keep the tutorial as minimal and simple as possible.

The reader should look at this tutorial as the first step, and mainly a gateway to setup a Pinglue development environment and get things to work. After reading this tutorial you may move to other more specialized tutorials and/or the handbook to get a more practical prospective.
